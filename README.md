If deadlines slip, it can create problems with stakeholders and costs. To make sure deadlines are met, project managers should;set clear goals,track progress, anticipate risks, manage resources smartly, keep communication open.
2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?= @ Effective cost control ensures that the project stays within budget, which is essential for profitability and keeping the project on track. When costs get out of hand, it can derail the entire project. To prevent budget overruns, you can; plan a realistic budget, track spending, prioritize, negotiate with vendors for a good deal.
3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?=
@Agile:
  Advantages:
     Agile is all about flexibility. If requirements change or new ideas pop up, it’s easy to adapt.
     Regular feedback means you’re always improving and making the product better.
     It’s great for projects where things might evolve as you go.
  Disadvantages:
     Because it’s so flexible, it can sometimes be hard to predict the final product or delivery date.
     You need consistent involvement from stakeholders, which can be time-consuming.
     It can get tricky to manage in large teams with many moving parts.
@Waterfall:
  Advantages:
     It’s structured and easy to follow. Each phase has clear goals, so it’s easy to track progress.
     Perfect for projects where requirements are well-defined and unlikely to change.
     The timeline and deliverables are more predictable.
  Disadvantages:
    It’s tough to change things once you’re deep into development.
    If one phase is delayed, it affects the entire project.
    Less collaboration with stakeholders once the project is underway.
4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?=
- @ Agile is great when requirements are likely to change or evolve, or when you need flexibility and frequent feedback. An exanple is when developing a mobile app where user feedback can shape the final product and new features can be added as trends change
@ -Waterfall works best for projects where you know exactly what you need from the start, and changes aren’t likely or possible.An example is when building a regulated medical system where every requirement is fixed, and the process must follow strict rules.
5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?= @ Quality assurance is all about making sure the software works as it should and delivers a good experience to users. Here’s how to make sure quality is in the veins; code reviews, testing, user testing
6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?= @ it helps avoid surprises, ensures everyone’s aligned, and keeps the project on track. Without it, you risk wasting time and resources on things that aren't necessary.A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) breaks the project into smaller tasks, making it easier to manage. It’s useful because; helps identify potential risks, helps estimate time and resources more easily, helps ensure nothing important is missing, clarifies who's responible for each task.
7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?= @ Having a detailed project schedule gives you; clarity, progress tracking, better resource use. A Gantt chart is super helpful because it shows all tasks visually, with start and end dates, and how they relate to each other. This makes it easy to see where things might be falling behind and adjust accordingly.
